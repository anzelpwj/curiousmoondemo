# A Curious Moon in dbt

This is an exercise to get familiar with `dbt` by implementing several of the tables from Rob Conrey's ["A Curious Moon"](https://bigmachine.io/products/a-curious-moon/) in `dbt`. I am running this against a local Postgres instance.

This is for my [Introduction to dbt](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sxJCzLl7_Rz6gs3C9V7MiVGi7IVFXPsf0_UL-8qlREI/edit?usp=sharing) presentation.
